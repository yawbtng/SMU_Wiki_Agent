# BLOCKER — auto-mode recovery failed

Unit `complete-slice` for `M001/S01` failed to produce this artifact after idle recovery exhausted all retries.

**Reason**: Deterministic policy rejection for complete-slice "M001/S01": bash: HARD BLOCK: unit "complete-slice" runs under tools-policy "planning-dispatch" — bash is restricted to read-only commands (cat/grep/git log/etc); cannot run "python3 - <<'PY'
from pathlib import Path
for p in [
    Path('src/scrape_planne…". This is a mechanical gate enforced by manifest.tools (#4934). You MUST NOT proceed, retry the same call, or rationalize past this block. If you need to write user source, the work belongs in execute-task, not in a planning unit.. Retrying cannot resolve this gate — writing blocker placeholder to advance pipeline.

This placeholder was written by auto-mode so the pipeline can advance.
